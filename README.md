# raining-nyan-cats-game
This was the first project that I did as part of the Full-Stack Web Development program at Concordia University. I used pure JavaScript along with HTML and CSS to develop a game based on the Internet meme Nyan Cat. The game involves the user using the left and right arrow keys to move a burger and try to avoid the cats that are falling from the top of the screen.
